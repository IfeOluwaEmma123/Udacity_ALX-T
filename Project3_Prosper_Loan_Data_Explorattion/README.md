# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with Prosper Loan Data Exploration

This report explores a dataset provided by [Prosper](https://www.prosper.com) containing loan data for approximately 114,000 loans. The main areas of focus are on how different features such as loan amount, credit grade, and borrower monthly income relate to the APR (annual percentage rate) of a loan.
